# New-York-City-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Kaggle-

**Solution Using EDA + XGBoost (Without using any external dataset)**

In this competition, Kaggle is challenging us to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Our primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

**Note:**
   Since the dataset was large .[Here is the link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data) for the dataset.
